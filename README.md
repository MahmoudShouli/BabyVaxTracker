<a name="page3"></a>**Introduction**

The idea of the project is to provide an easy way for parents to book appointments for their expected newborns to get their necessary vaccines in time or to book consultations with our crew. This idea raised from observing and finding the lack of such platforms in our country, so we took the chance and agreed to channel our energy onto this challenging journey and try out best to come up with a high quality product.

Once we came up the main idea, we started brainstorming and analyzing, we imagined how our website would look like, how it will work and what features it has. We divided the tasks fairly between the two and worked like a team, we would never achieve this project without either of us.

We learned a handful of skills throughout this project, we had to dig deep for us to find the implementation of our ideas, and we faced a lot of challenges and bugs, but thankfully we have overcome them and didnâ€™t give up at any point. The material taken in the university course also came in very handy for us thanks to Dr. Sufyan!

Our website is reliable, secure, responsive, user-friendly, attractive and full of features, it revolutionizes the classic appointments method, since our website enables you to post your thoughts and ideas and interact with other peopleâ€™s ideas.






<a name="page4"></a>**Requirements & Features**

- <a name="registration"></a>**Registration:**

- <a name="validation"></a>**Form Validation:**

- ![](Aspose.Words.e806b02a-a198-44c2-9385-fe9aa214e327.002.png)When the user registers to our system, a form validation is performed, meaning there are certain criteria for some input fields, for example the full name cannot be one name only, emails and phone numbers must be unique and cannot match other userâ€™s info, the emails and phone number must be formatted a specific way, the password and confirm password field must match, the child date must be a current date or a future date, meaning the parents must book these appointment before their child is born.

- <a name="userfeatures"></a>**Schedules:**

- Users can look at the schedule table for each one of our doctors.

- When you visit the page, you will have a list of all the doctors that you can choose from and display their schedules

![](Aspose.Words.e806b02a-a198-44c2-9385-fe9aa214e327.016.png)


- Letâ€™s for example choose Dr. Mahmoud

![](Aspose.Words.e806b02a-a198-44c2-9385-fe9aa214e327.017.png)


- The center is open from Sunday to Thursday from 8 am to 4 pm, meaning you can book any time you like in that duration.


- So we notice that from 1 to 3 pm Dr.Mahmoud is unavailable meaning I canâ€™t book at these times, but the others are all unbooked mean I can book any of them.

- Letâ€™s Book An Appointment!




- **Booking Appointments**

- You will have a list of all your childâ€™s to choose from.
- Then a list of the doctors to choose from.
- The date which should be formatted exactly like how itâ€™s shown in the placeholder, otherwise it will warn you.

1) One child can have only one appointment.
1) You canâ€™t book a booked or unavailable date.

- Letâ€™s try to book for Ahmad with Dr Mahmoud on Monday 8 Am.
